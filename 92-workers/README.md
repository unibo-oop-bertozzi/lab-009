# Workers

## Instructions

Solve the exercises in the following order:

1. `workers01` (see the corresponding package)
    - Here look carefully at the example, which is already solved for you. Read the comments.
    - Look at the test classes, implemented using JUnit 5.
    - There is a special version using `Stream`s, it's there only to give you a glance of advanced Java programming.
2. `workers02` (see the corresponding package)
    - See the instructions in `TestMatrix` - and notice how a test can be written before the actual implementation (cf. TDD).
